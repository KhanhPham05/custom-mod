### About my mod
This is a mod for the villains and heroes in the ben 10 series. The villains will be created first and then the heroes.

 

In this mod you will be able to fight villains such as Vilgax, Doctor Animo, ect and i will be adding heroes such as Quin but that is in the future. I am focusing on villains. I will be adding swords that were used in ben 10 such as Ascalon and i may add Annihilargh. note this weapon will destroy your world because this is what it does in the series. I will ad the hoverboard in Ben 10 Omniverse and also to have the best experience use  https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/heroes-united-ben-10. In that mod you can use the omnitrix which means you can turn into Ben 10 transformation and use them against the villains. <The heroes united ben 10 mod is not my mod its made by the Heroes United crew. I will be adding the dragon armour from the series first and also the sword Ascalon. 

 

to mine the legendary block or ore you will need a diamond pickaxe. The same applies for ruby ore or block 

wearing the armour will make you near to invincible and the sword will be really strong but the ore will be rare so you will have to mine a-lot to find. Great power does not come without working hard to obtain it.
